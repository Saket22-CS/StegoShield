## 📌 **Problem Statement**  
In today's digital age, secure communication is crucial. Traditional encryption methods may raise suspicion, while unprotected messages risk exposure. **StegoShield** solves this by embedding secret messages inside images using **Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography**, making the hidden data invisible to the human eye.

## 🖼️ **Usage**  
### **1️⃣ Hide a Message in an Image**
🔹 Select an image  
🔹 Enter a secret message & password  
🔹 Click "Encode" to generate a stego-image  

### **2️⃣ Extract a Message**
🔹 Load the stego-image  
🔹 Enter the correct password  
🔹 Click "Decode" to reveal the hidden message  

---

## 📊 **Result**  
🔹 Successfully hides text within images without noticeable distortion  
🔹 Ensures **secure message transmission** without raising suspicion  
🔹 **Maintains image integrity**, making detection nearly impossible  

---

## 🔮 **Future Scope**  
🔹 **AES Encryption Layer** – Add an extra layer of security before embedding messages  
🔹 **Audio & Video Steganography** – Expand beyond images  
🔹 **Cloud Integration** – Secure stego-image storage & retrieval  
🔹 **Mobile App Development** – Android/iOS version for better accessibility
